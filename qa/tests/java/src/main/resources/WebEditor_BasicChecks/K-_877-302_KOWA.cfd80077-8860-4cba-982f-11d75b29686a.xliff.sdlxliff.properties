Introduction
You are invited to take part in a clinical research study.
The study has been approved by a Drug Research Ethics Committee and by the Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios in accordance with current legislation, Royal Decree 1090/2015 of 4 December and European Regulation 536/2014 of 16 April, which govern clinical drug trials.
Your participation in this study is voluntary and you can decide NOT to participate.
If you decide to participate, you can change your mind and withdraw your consent at any time, without this affecting your relationship with your doctor or causing any harm whatsoever to your health care.
To help you decide, please take the time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others.
This may include your spouse or partner, a friend or relative.
Please ask your study doctor if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.
It cannot be promised that the study will help you, but in the future the information we get from this study, may help improve the treatment of people suffering with the disease or condition researched.
If you decide that you want to take part, you will be asked to sign this informed consent form.
You will be given a copy of the signed form to keep, and the original will stay at the study center.
Around 10,000 subjects in 750 study centers located in more than 20 countries around the world will take part in this study.
What is the purpose of the study and why you have been invited?
The purpose of this study is to find out if of K-877 (also called pemafibrate), the study drug, compared to placebo (a treatment which looks like the medicine but contains no active pemafibrate), lowers cardiovascular (CV) complications (also referred to as “events”), such as heart attack, stroke, and death from these conditions, in adults with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) who have elevated triglycerides (TGs; one type of fat), and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C; “good” cholesterol).
The study will also test whether the study drug has other possible benefits in subjects with diabetes, and will test the safety of the study drug.
What medication is being tested?
K-877 (pemafibrate) is an experimental drug that treats abnormal cholesterol levels (high TGs and/or low HDL-C).
Experimental means that it has not been approved by government authorities and is still being tested for safety and effectiveness.
If you decide to take part in this study and your doctor considers you qualify for the study, you will continue taking the cholesterol lowering medication that you are currently receiving, and you will be asked to take one tablet twice a day for the entire duration of the study.
The content of the tablet will be varied during the study and at some point, for a short time, you will receive placebo only and at other points you will receive either the study drug or placebo.
At a certain point of time during the study, you will be assigned permanently to study drug or placebo and you will stay in this treatment until the end of the study.
You will have an equal chance (1:1) of receiving one of the following:
Pemafibrate 0.2 mg twice a day
Placebo twice a day
The assignment of treatment is random (like the flip of a coin).
Neither you nor your doctor will know which treatment you are taking to allow the effects of the drugs to be checked fairly.
However, in an emergency, your doctor can find out exactly which medication you are taking.
What will happen to you during the study?
Taking part in this study will last approximatively 5 years and it includes a Screening period visits (to check if the study is right for you), an evaluation period visits (while you are taking the drug), and a follow-up period (to check your health after you stop receiving the study medication).
During this time you will be required to visit your clinical center several times or discuss your participation in the study by phone.
The visits and tests or assessments you will have during the study are described in the sections below.
Study tests and assessments
The tests and assessments that may take place at one or all of your study visits are described below.
Physical examination: An external examination will be carried out to check your overall health.
This will include checks of your body systems and organs
Vital signs: This will include checks of your heart rate and blood pressure.
At certain visits, your height, weight, and waist circumference will be measured, and your body mass index (BMI) calculated.
Questionnaires: You will complete a questionnaire to assess your quality of life.
Side effects: At each visit, the study doctor will ask about any side effect you may have
Urine samples: These samples are used to check your general health and function of your kidneys.
Blood samples: A maximum of about 64 mL of blood is drawn at each visit for a total of about 460 mL during the entire study (approximatively 5 years)to check:
Your general health, the health of your liver, kidneys, and levels of other substances in your blood, such as certain minerals, electrolytes, proteins, lipids, glucose, and cholesterol;
For pregnancy (if you are a female who could get pregnant);
If you agree to the optional sampling, your blood will be archived and possibly used for future research testing.

What alternative treatments are available?
Your study doctor will discuss with you any other treatments available.
If you decide not to take part in this study it will not affect your ability to receive medical care.
You can refuse to participate in or withdraw from the trial without penalty or loss of benefits.
What could be the side effects of the study drug?
The possible discomforts, side effects, and risks related to study drug treatment are not all completely known.
For your safety, you must inform your study doctor about all medicines you are taking.
Up to today, there is limited clinical experience in the use of the study drug beyond one year.
The following side effects have been seen in more than 2% of the 1363 subjects treated with the study drug during clinical studies but none of the side effects were confirmed to have been caused by the study drug:
nasopharyngitis (swelling of nose and throat, which may cause runny nose, sneezing, sore throat and fever)
swelling of the upper respiratory tract
worsening of diabetes mellitus (high blood sugar levels)
increased blood levels of creatine phosphokinase (an enzyme in the body, mainly found in the heart, brain, and muscles)
You could experience an allergic reaction with the use of the study drug.
Allergic reactions are serious and could be life threatening if not treated promptly.
Some signs are: rash or hives, having a hard time breathing, wheezing when you breathe, sudden change in blood pressure (making you feel dizzy or lightheaded), swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes, fast pulse (heart rate) and weating.
Evaluation of the potential to produce cancer in animals has been completed for pemafibrate.
Pemafibrate induced tumors in mice and rats at human equivalent doses of 0.4 mg/day and 3 mg/day, respectively.
Those findings are common in the same class of drugs as pemafibrate, for example fenofibrate, and there is substantial evidence that rodents may be far more sensitive to these effects compared to humans though the risk in humans cannot be entirely ruled out.
Other medicines you may be taking could have a negative effect when taken with the study drug.
An increased risk for breakdown of muscle tissue that leads to the release of muscle fiber contents into the blood have been observed with similar drugs when administered along with statins.
There is a chance that the study drug may not help in preventing or reducing cardiovascular events in subjects like you, and that your condition might worsen.
If you receive placebo, there will be no additional effects on your current medications or treatments, so your condition may stay the same or become worse.
Any side effects or other health issues occurring during the study will be followed up by the study doctor.
What are the possible disadvantages or risks of taking part?
It is possible that the symptoms of your condition will not improve during the study or may even worsen.
Treatment with this study drug may also involve risks to your future health that we currently don’t know about.
Blood samples:You will need to have samples of blood taken during the trial.
The blood sampling may cause local pain, bruising, swelling, lightheadedness, dizziness and rarely, fainting and/or a possible infection at the blood sampling site.
Harm to the unborn child: Currently we are not fully aware of the effects of the study drug on unborn babies, or pregnant or breastfeeding women.
Women who can have children will be asked to take a pregnancy test, at the start of the study.
You must be using an effective form of birth control before you start the study drug and while you are taking part in the study.
You must also agree to continue to use an effective form of birth control for 1 additional menstrual cycle following the final study visit.
Effective birth control includes:
oral, implanted or injectable hormonal contraceptives,
intrauterine devices (IUDs),
barrier methods (e.g. condoms, diaphragm, and cervical cap) with spermicide.
If you become pregnant during the study or within 1 month of stopping the study drug, you should immediately tell the study doctor.
It will be necessary for you to stop taking the study drug immediately and discontinue the study.
Your study doctor will be required to collect information about your pregnancy through the outcome of the pregnancy, and provide this information to the Sponsor.
Treatment of this information will follow the requirements stipulated in Organic Law 15/1999 on Personal Data Protection.
What happens when the research study stops?
The study drug will not be available as a prescription paid for by the health care system immediately after the end of the study.
You will not continue to receive this particular drug or treatment when you have finished taking part in the study.
Your study doctor will consider the most suitable alternative for you.
Your participation in the study may end at any time if you decide to withdraw or your study doctor decides you should be withdrawn.
You may also stop taking the study drug but continue to be followed in the study if you have reaction to the study drug or you become pregnant.
Study medication may be stopped temporarily for a number of reasons.
You are allowed to restart the treatment with study drug after stopping if the condition leading to study drug interruption has resolved.
The Sponsor may terminate the trial for any number of reasons, including without limitation for the safety of subjects in the trial, if the experimental drug is not working well enough or when sufficient data for evaluation is collected.
If you have a reaction to the study drug, your participation may be stopped at any time by the study doctor or sponsor without your consent.
If the study is stopped, you will be told and your study doctor will make arrangements for continuation of your care.
