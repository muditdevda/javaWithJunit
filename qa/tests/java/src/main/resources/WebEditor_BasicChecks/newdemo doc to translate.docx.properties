Avian influenza: assessing the pandemic threat
Recent events make it likely that some migratory birds are now directly spreading the H5N1 virus in its highly pathogenic form.
Further to new areas is expected.
The first cases in the present outbreak occurred in December 2003 in Viet Nam.
By early April 2006, close to 200 laboratory-confirmed human cases had been reported from nine countries: Azerbaijan, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Thailand, Turkey, and Viet Nam.
In humans, the virus causes severe disseminated disease affecting multiple organs and systems.
Infection has been fatal in more than half of the cases.
For unknown reasons, most cases have occurred in previously healthy children and young adults.

An influenza pandemic is a public health emergency that quickly takes on significant political, social, and economic dimensions.
About 80% of human infections donâ€™t show any symptoms; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver and spleen.
The incubation period of Lassa fever can range from 5-22 days.
The onset of the disease is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness, and general malaise.
After a few days, headache, sore throat, muscle and chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, and abdominal may follow.
