Chapter 2 looks at past pandemics as a basis for assessing what may be on its way
Avian influenza: assessing the pandemic threat
Recent events make it likely that some migratory birds are now directly spreading the H5N1 virus in its highly pathogenic form.
Further spread to new areas is expected.
The first cases in the present outbreak occurred in December 2003 in Viet Nam.
By early April 2006, close to 200 laboratory-confirmed human cases had been reported from nine countries: Azerbaijan, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Thailand, Turkey, and Viet Nam.
In humans, the virus causes severe disseminated disease affecting multiple organs and systems.
Infection has been fatal in more than half of the cases.
For unknown reasons, most cases have occurred in previously healthy children and young adults.
The H5N1 outbreaks in 2004: a pandemic in waiting?
The first report of something unusual came from the Republic of Korea in mid-December 2003.
Veterinarians were concerned that these seasonal epidemics would spread to other regions of the world, such as the lassa fever did before.
An influenza pandemic is a public health emergency that quickly takes on significant political, social, and economic dimensions.
As with other emerging infectious diseases, it is important to identify if itâ€™s emerging from a new causative agent which requires some time to identify and understand.
