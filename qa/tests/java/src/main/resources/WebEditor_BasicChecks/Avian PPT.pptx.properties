What is avian influenza?
Avian influenza, or “bird flu”, is a contagious disease of animals caused by viruses that usually infect only birds and, less commonly, pigs.
Avian influenza viruses are highly species-specific, but have, on rare occasions, crossed the species barrier to infect humans.
What is avian influenza?
In domestic poultry, infection with avian influenza viruses causes two main forms of disease, distinguished by low and high extremes of virulence.
The so-called “low pathogenic” form causes only mild symptoms (ruffled feathers, a drop in egg production) and may easily go undetected.
The highly pathogenic form is far more dramatic.
